# End-to-End Data Analysis Project (Python & MySQL)

This is an end-to-end data analysis project using a sample dataset from Kaggle. The project involves data cleaning and transformation using Python (Pandas), followed by exporting the cleaned data to MySQL. The analysis was then continued using SQL queries in MySQL Workbench to extract insights.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Summary

1. *Data Cleaning with Python*
   - Loaded dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and data formatting issues
   - Performed feature selection and transformation

2. *Exporting to MySQL*
   - Established connection with MySQL using sqlalchemy / mysql-connector-python
   - Created a table and exported cleaned DataFrame to MySQL database

3. *SQL-Based Data Analysis*
   - Connected to MySQL Workbench
   - Queried cleaned data for exploratory analysis and insights
   - Performed aggregations, joins, filtering, and grouping
