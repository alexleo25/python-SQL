# End-to-End Data Analysis Project (Python & MySQL)

This is an end-to-end data analysis project using a sample dataset from Kaggle. The project involves data cleaning and transformation using Python (Pandas), followed by exporting the cleaned data to MySQL. The analysis was then continued using SQL queries in MySQL Workbench to extract insights.
